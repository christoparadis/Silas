Hi! This game was made along side a final for COMP3770 (Game Development). 
A simple 2.5d platformer that utilizes procedural platform generation and finite state machine.

All of the 3d models and pixel art were made by me as well.
Being my first time modeling and animating, I used blender and photoshop for all of the assets/sprites for their ease of use.
