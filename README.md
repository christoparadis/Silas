Hi! This game was made along side a final for COMP3770 (Game Development). 
A simple 2.5d platformer that utilizes procedural platform generation and finite state machine.


## Inspiration 

The game was heavily inspired by:
 - Ori and the Blind Forest
 - Super Mario Galaxy
 - Shovel Knight

## Programs used

 - Unity High-Definition Render Pipeline (**C#**)
 - Visual Studio Code / Intellij 
 - Blender 
 - Substance Painter
 - Photoshop CC
 - [BoscaCeoil](https://boscaceoil.net/)
 - Agile Kaban Board

# Art

All of the 3d models and pixel art were made by me as well.
Being my first time modeling and animating, I used blender and photoshop for all of the assets/sprites for their ease of use.
